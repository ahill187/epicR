\description{
This function runs validation tests for COPD exacerbation rates by GOLD stage
and compares them with reference values from studies such as CanCOLD, CIHI,
and Hoogendoorn. It simulates exacerbation events, and returns key metrics,
including overall exacerbation rates, rates by GOLD stage, and rates in
diagnosed vs. undiagnosed patients.
