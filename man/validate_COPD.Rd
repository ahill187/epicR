\title{Returns results of validation tests for COPD}
\usage{
validate_COPD(incident_COPD_k = 1, return_CI = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{incident_COPD_k}{a number (default=1) by which the incidence rate of COPD will be multiplied.}

\item{return_CI}{if TRUE, returns 95 percent confidence intervals for the "Year" coefficient}
}
\value{
validation test results

\description{
This function runs validation tests for COPD model outputs. It estimates the baseline
prevalence and incidence of COPD, along with sex-specific baseline COPD prevalence.
Additionally, it calculates the baseline prevalence of COPD by age groups and
smoking pack-years. It also estimates the coefficients for the relationships between
age, pack-years, smoking status, and the prevalence of COPD.
